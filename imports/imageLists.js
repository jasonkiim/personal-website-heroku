The objective of the robot is to detect different coloured balls and sort them by dispensing them into the corresponding bins. Our group used motion sensors, colour sensor, as well as two servo motors to create this robot. The sensor feedback created from the sensors were integrated to map the rotation of the robot as well to adjust the locations of the bins correspondingly, programmed in Robot C.'

This car was programmed on a TI LaunchPad, and has a line-following algorithm that allows the car to follow the black line in a maze. This project involved lots of trial and error because the maze had various types of barriers the car needed to avoid using integrated sensors.'

Each users are able to create events by a to-do-list addon on the calendar. This was approached via LinkedLists and Inheritance. The calendar itself was designed using hitboxes of 2D arrays, and the calendar data, such as Years, Months, were approached via Inheritance, LinkedLists, and manipulation of text files.'

The contestant rolls the first die; if the number rolled matches the second digit, the digit is revealed and shown on both screens. Otherwise, the contestant must decide whether the digit is higher or lower than the roll and his or her selection is marked with an outline of lights. If the player gets all guesses right for the digits, they win a prize.'
